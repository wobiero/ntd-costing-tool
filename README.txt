This is a Streamlit tool for estimating rough costs of different courses of action for NTD elimination across countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The current diseases supported are lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis. The user is required to select the appropriate geographical unit through a series of dropdown menus and to calibrate different in-built inputs to obtain the relevant estimates. The use of the tool presupposes some knowledge of NTDs.
